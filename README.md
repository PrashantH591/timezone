# Time Zone Converter - Overview

This program is a simple time zone converter. The user will be able to interact with the program in three ways:

* Display the time zones from a file available for conversion
* Convert one time zone to another, which is the bulk of the program
* Add custom time zones which can be saved to a file for later use

I wrote this software in order to practice using the Python programming language. I made a simple class that stores the idea of Time in hours, minutes, and seconds, and it is able to display the time in both 12- and 24-hour formats. It utilizes functions, loops, expressions, reading and writing to files, and other basic aspects of Python.

Here's a link to a demo of my program: [Software Demo Video](https://youtu.be/IxjR7FRn6eI)

# Future Work

There are a few things I'd like to one day improve upon this program in the future.

* Present the time zones better, either with more columns or a map of the world
* Add a capability to notify the user whether an area is currently observing daylight savings or not
* Incorporate days of the week and dates for added clarity in time zone conversions (in addition to the "Yesterday", "Today", and "Tomorrow" already present)
* A way to prevent the user from crashing the program with an unexpected non-numerical variable (such as entering "dog" for a UTC)
